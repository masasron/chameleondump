# ChameleonDump

## Overview

ChameleonDump is a user-friendly command-line tool for macOS.
Its primary function is to show the security vulnerability that
arises from using hardcoded, default BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) PIN codes.

The tool attempts to connect to ChameleonUltra devices using their
default BLE PIN code. Once connected, ChameleonDump extracts all stored RFID tag IDs from the device.
As of now, the tool supports only the ChameleonUltra device.

**⚠️ Note: This tool is designed for educational purposes only. Please use it
responsibly and only on devices you own or have explicit permission to test.**

## What Can You Do?

### For Developers

Multiple solutions exist for mitigating this security risk. The most
straightforward approach would be to require users to change the default PIN
when they first set up the device.

### For Users

Change the default PIN code of your ChameleonUltra device.
